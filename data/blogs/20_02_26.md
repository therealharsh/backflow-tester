If you've ever received a compliance notice from your water utility asking you to schedule a backflow test, your first instinct was probably to call a plumber. That makes sense — plumbers handle water systems, right? But then maybe you noticed the notice specifically mentioned a "certified backflow tester," and now you're wondering if those are the same thing, and whether it matters.

It does matter, and you're not alone in finding it confusing. This guide will walk you through exactly what each professional does, where their roles overlap, and who you should be calling depending on your situation — so you can get into compliance quickly and confidently.

## <a name="_ax5tdc8oeut"></a>**What Is Backflow and Why Does It Matter?**
To understand why any of this is necessary, it helps to understand what backflow actually is.

Your home or building is connected to a municipal water supply that delivers clean, pressurized drinking water. Under normal conditions, that water flows in one direction — from the main supply line into your property. Backflow is what happens when that flow reverses, allowing water from your property's plumbing to flow backward into the public water supply.

This might sound like a minor inconvenience, but it can be a serious public health hazard. Water that flows back into the system can carry contaminants — fertilizers, pesticides, chemicals, bacteria, or even sewage — that then mix with the drinking water supply for your entire neighborhood or community. There have been documented cases of community-wide contamination events caused by backflow, which is why water authorities treat it with such urgency.

The situations that cause backflow are called cross-connections — any point in a plumbing system where potable (drinkable) water could come into contact with a potentially contaminated source. Common examples include irrigation systems, fire suppression systems, commercial food equipment, and certain industrial setups.

## <a name="_olyvkoiqlhw8"></a>**What Is a Backflow Prevention Device?**
A backflow prevention device is a mechanical assembly installed at a cross-connection point to stop water from flowing in the wrong direction. Think of it as a one-way gate — it allows water to pass through in the intended direction but closes automatically if the pressure or flow conditions change in a way that could cause reversal.

There are several types of backflow preventers, and the right one depends on the level of hazard at a given location. A reduced pressure zone (RPZ) assembly, for example, is used in high-hazard situations like irrigation systems connected to chemical fertilizer injectors. A double check valve assembly is more common in lower-hazard residential settings.

Because these are mechanical devices, they can wear out, corrode, or fail over time — often without any visible signs. That's why most municipalities require that backflow prevention devices be tested annually by a qualified professional and that the results be reported to the water authority. This annual testing requirement is usually what triggers the compliance notice you received.

## <a name="_etxok7xcooi"></a>**Understanding the Two Roles**
Here's where the distinction that matters most comes into play.

**A licensed plumber** has completed a formal apprenticeship or trade program, passed a licensing exam, and is authorized to work on plumbing systems — including installing, repairing, and replacing pipes, fixtures, and devices like backflow preventers. Licensing is regulated at the state level, so requirements vary, but all licensed plumbers have demonstrated competency in general plumbing work.

What a standard plumber's license does not automatically authorize them to do is certify backflow testing results. Testing a backflow preventer isn't just about checking whether it physically works — it involves using specialized gauges, following a precise testing protocol, documenting specific pressure readings, and submitting a report to the water authority in a format they'll accept. That process requires a separate, specific credential.

**A certified backflow tester** (sometimes called a backflow prevention assembly tester or BPAT) has completed training specifically focused on backflow prevention technology, passed a certification exam, and is authorized by their state or local water authority to perform compliance testing and submit official reports. This certification is distinct from a plumbing license and must typically be renewed on a regular basis through continuing education.

Here's the key distinction: a certified backflow tester can perform and certify the annual test your water utility requires. But if your device fails that test and needs to be repaired or replaced, that work generally falls under plumbing — meaning a licensed plumber needs to step in.

The good news is that many licensed plumbers also hold backflow certification. For them, the two roles aren't in conflict at all — they're simply a plumber with an additional credential.

## <a name="_fayn3wyslo8i"></a>**So Who Do You Actually Call?**
Once you understand the roles, the decision becomes fairly straightforward.

**If you've received a compliance notice for annual testing**, you need a certified backflow tester. This is the person who can legally perform the test, document the results, and file the report with your water authority. Calling a plumber who isn't backflow-certified won't satisfy your compliance requirement, even if they're perfectly capable of looking at the device.

**If your backflow preventer has failed, needs repair, or needs to be replaced**, you need a licensed plumber. Installation and repair work on plumbing systems falls squarely within a plumber's scope of work. Depending on your jurisdiction, permits may also be required for this kind of work.

**If you want the most convenient and complete experience**, look for a licensed plumber who also holds backflow certification. This is actually quite common, especially among plumbers who specialize in commercial properties or irrigation systems. A dual-credentialed professional can test your device, repair or replace it if necessary, and file all the required paperwork — all in one visit. This is particularly valuable if you manage multiple properties or just don't want to coordinate between two different contractors.

## <a name="_p7uq2wfy1oed"></a>**What to Look for When Hiring**
Credentials are everything in this space, because the consequences of hiring someone unqualified go beyond bad work — they can leave you officially out of compliance even after you've paid for a service.

When vetting a professional, ask directly whether they are a certified backflow tester and which certifying body issued their credential. In the United States, the most widely recognized certification comes from the [American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA)](https://www.abpa.org) or the [American Society of Sanitary Engineering (ASSE)](https://asse-plumbing.org). Many states also have their own certification programs, and some water authorities only accept testers on an approved list — so it's worth checking with your utility to see if they have specific requirements.

You should also confirm that their certification is current. Certifications expire, and an expired credential is no credential at all. A reputable professional will have no hesitation providing this information.

A few red flags to watch for: anyone who quotes you a price but can't tell you clearly what certifications they hold, anyone who seems unfamiliar with the reporting process in your area, and anyone offering unusually low prices without explanation. Proper testing requires calibrated equipment and takes time — if the price seems too good to be true, it often means corners are being cut.

Finally, make sure you receive a copy of the filed test report for your own records. This is your proof of compliance, and you'll want it if your water utility ever questions whether testing was completed.

## <a name="_cche02z7jrzp"></a>**What Happens If You Don't Get It Done?**
Skipping or delaying backflow testing isn't just an administrative inconvenience — it carries real consequences.

Most water authorities will issue fines for missed testing deadlines, and repeated non-compliance can result in water service being shut off to your property until the issue is resolved. For businesses, that's potentially a devastating interruption to operations. For landlords and property managers, it can also create liability exposure if a backflow event causes contamination and it comes out that testing wasn't up to date.

Beyond the regulatory side, there's a genuine safety element. A failed backflow preventer that goes undetected isn't just a compliance problem — it's a potential health risk to you, your tenants, and your neighbors. Annual testing exists for a good reason, and the cost of staying current is minor compared to what it takes to deal with the alternative.

## <a name="_tnivurcfrb6z"></a>**The Bottom Line**
The difference between a certified backflow tester and a licensed plumber isn't about one being better than the other — it's about each having a specific role. For your annual compliance testing, you need someone with backflow certification. For installation or repair work, you need a licensed plumber. And when you can find someone who holds both credentials, you get the best of both worlds in one phone call.

When in doubt, start by checking with your water utility. They can tell you exactly what they require, point you toward approved testers in your area, and clarify any local rules that might affect who you need to hire. A little homework upfront will save you time, money, and the headache of starting over with the right person after hiring the wrong one.
